## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Media Archive Readiness

The Telegram media archive flow requires these `user_media` columns:

- `archive_group_id`
- `archive_topic_id`
- `archive_message_id`

Startup now verifies this schema before media-archive processing is enabled. If columns are missing, startup/readiness fails with migration guidance.

### Migration Order (All Environments)

1. Pull latest code and install dependencies.
2. Run database migrations (`pnpm run migrate`) against the target DB.
3. Verify required columns exist before rollout:

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name = 'user_media'
  AND column_name IN ('archive_group_id', 'archive_topic_id', 'archive_message_id');
```

4. Start or deploy application instances only after the DB passes verification.

### Pre-Deploy Checklist

- [ ] Target DB migrated with latest Drizzle migration chain
- [ ] `user_media` archive columns verified in target environment
- [ ] Release logs monitored for `media_archive.schema_readiness.*` events after startup
- [ ] Optional blur dependency status reviewed (`media_blur.degraded_mode` warning means blur is disabled, non-fatal)

### Rollback Guidance

- App-only rollback is supported.
- Do **not** drop `user_media` archive columns during app rollback.
- If rollback is needed, roll back application artifacts only and keep DB schema at or ahead of app expectations.

### Staging Validation Matrix

- **Migrated staging DB:** startup succeeds, archive persistence writes succeed, no schema-mismatch diagnostics.
- **Intentionally non-migrated staging DB:** startup/readiness blocks media archive flow, logs include missing columns and migration remediation.
- **Optional blur dependency missing:** service remains available, logs emit `media_blur.degraded_mode`, media forwarding continues without blur.

## Project setup

$ pnpm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ pnpm run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ pnpm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
